The availability KPIs measure the percentage of time during which the network cells
have not been available. According to 3GPP, one cell is considered to be available
when eNodeB can offer E-RAB services in that particular cell.
The E-UTRAN Cell Availability measures the percentage of time in order to evaluate
the service degradation and the network performance. This parameter can be measured
in the cluster level (eq. 7).

 What Is the Difference Between Stochastic and Deterministic Models?
Unlike deterministic models that produce the same exact results for a particular set of inputs, stochastic models are the opposite; the model presents data and predicts outcomes that account for certain levels of unpredictability or randomness. TSt


Dear xyz,

In reference to our conversation earlier regarding my joining date, I would like to state that I will be trying my best to join Messer dated 15th Jan, 2022. 

However, there are a few concerns that I would like address. As you are already aware that I recently came back to India, I am in the middle of renovating and furnishing our apartment. As the holiday season approaches, I expect a slight delay in the apartment furnishing.

Additionally, my mother is also undergoing her heart treatment here in Pune, and I am also in the middle of a dental treatment. It would be difficult for me to discontinue the treatment abruptly.

I would very much like to finish all there works and treatment before I can join Messers. 

As mentioned, I will try my level best to finish all my work in Pune and join Messer dated 15th Jan, 2022. But if there are any delays, I would like to request that I shall join Messer starting February 1, 2022. In any case, I shall make sure that as soon as I join Messer, I will devote all my time to the work on Delhi and assume my responsibilities with utmost dedication.

Thank you very much, and I wish you a good day ahead.

Best regards,
Mangesh Deo
