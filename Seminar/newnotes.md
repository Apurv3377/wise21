The availability KPIs measure the percentage of time during which the network cells
have not been available. According to 3GPP, one cell is considered to be available
when eNodeB can offer E-RAB services in that particular cell.
The E-UTRAN Cell Availability measures the percentage of time in order to evaluate
the service degradation and the network performance. This parameter can be measured
in the cluster level (eq. 7).
